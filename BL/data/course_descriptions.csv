Since 1978 Professor Greg Nagy has taught the course to undergraduates at Harvard College and to students at the Harvard Extension School. In March of 2013 The Ancient Greek Hero (“HeroesX”) became one of HarvardX’s first offerings as well as one of the first humanities courses to be offered on the edX platform.HeroesX is organized around 24 “Hours” a term that emerged from the 24 hours of classroom time in the residential version of the Ancient Greek Hero. Each Hour in HeroesX includes an overview lecture from Prof. Nagy and a conversation among Nagy and various members of the HeroesX “Board of Readers” scholars and students who work with Nagy to interpret and comment on the texts. Each week also includes a set of selected passages for “close reading.” These passages are read in performance by a student and discussed by Nagy and his colleagues. In some Hours ancient texts are paired with modern media including film. This report describes one of the first HarvardX courses HeroesX. The report was prepared by researchers external to the course team based on examination of the courseware analyses of the data collected by the edX platform and interviews and consultations with the course faculty and team members. The report proceeds in six parts. We begin by describing the goals of the HeroesX course team in the belief that any learning environment should be evaluated in the context of its intents values and vision. We then describe the structure of HeroesX followed by an examination of the participants who registered for the project. With an understanding of what the course team created and the learners who took an interest in the course we then turn to examining how participants interacted with the resources including their patterns of assessment-taking persistence and overall activity. We end by examining the limits of our understanding of student learning in these online courses and the future directions of the HeroesX project. Our hope is that this report and its companion reports—including a synthetic multiple-course report and other reports from the first HarvardX courses—will inspire new avenues of research and provide insights to future course designers in designing the next generation of open online courses. ,"To read “out of,” rather than “into,” a literary text, which is the art of close reading, The definition of a “hero” in the Classical Greek sense, contrasted with modern concepts of heroism, The relationship between epic and lyric in the ancient Greek tradition, To explore the interaction of text and image in the ancient Greek tradition, About hero cult and the role of heroes as objects of worship in ancient Greece, About the connection between myth and ritual in ancient Greec",1,1,25873,1803,1395,6.99,5.41,77.09,77.05,13.76,18.05,140.72,46.26,32,53.31,46.69,71.95

Chan School of Public Health's classes in epidemiology and biostatistics. Principled investigations to monitor and thus improve the health of individuals are firmly based on a sound understanding of modern quantitative methods. This involves the ability to discover patterns and extract knowledge from health data on a sample of individuals and then to infer, with measured uncertainty, the unobserved population characteristics. This course will address this need by covering the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research. These include outcomes measurement, measures of associations between outcomes and their determinants, study design options, bias and confounding, probability and diagnostic tests, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, power and sample size determinations, life tables and survival methods, regression methods (both, linear and logistic), and sample survey techniques. Students will analyze sample data sets to acquire knowledge of appropriate computer software.

It develops a toolkit of interdisciplinary analytical approaches and uses them to examine historical and contemporary global health initiatives with careful attention to a critical sociology of knowledge. Four physician-anthropologists - Paul Farmer, Arthur Kleinman, Anne Becker, and Salmaan Keshavjee - draw on experience working in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Americas to investigate what the field of global health comprises, how global health problems are defined and constructed, and how global health interventions play out in both expected and unexpected ways The course seeks to inspire and teach the following principles A global awareness. This course aims to enable learners to recognize the role of distinctive traditions, governments, and histories in shaping health and well being. In addition, rather than framing a faceless mass of poor populations as the subject of global health initiatives, the course uses ethnographies and case studies to situate global health problems in relation to the lives of individuals, families, and communities A foundation in social and historical analysis. The course demonstrates the value of social theory and historical analysis in understanding health and illness at individual and societal levels An ethical engagement.
